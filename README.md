# p2p-calls-app

Simple example of a peer-to-peer chat and call application using WebRTC and a tiny WebSocket server.

## Setup

Run the server with Node (no dependencies are required):

```bash
node server.js
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` and join with a name. Share the URL with another person to chat or start a call.
Messages are shown on the page and you can start or hang up video calls with other connected users.
